- Process payments using Stripe
- Create and manage subscriptions
- Cancel subscriptions
- Store subscription details in the database

## Tech Stack

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the frontend
- Node.js and Express for the backend

- MongoDB (or any other database of choice) for storing subscription data

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `npm install`.
3. Set up your Stripe account and obtain API keys.
4. Configure environment variables (e.g., Stripe API keys) in a `.env` file (not included in this repository).
5. Run the server using `npm start`.
6. Open the app in your web browser.

## Project Structure

- `public/` - Static files (HTML, CSS, client-side JavaScript)
